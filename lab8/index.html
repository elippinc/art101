				  <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>Using the console and trying to get the fuction to work became a huge problem for use. The was errors on almost very step of the way and it was really frustrating.</p>
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>One of the issues we had on the last part was with declaring the array.map. We kept putting "isOdd" instead of function(x)</p>
					<h2>Results</h2>
          <p>We were able to create and run the script properly after fixing that.</p>
