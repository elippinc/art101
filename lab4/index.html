	<h2>Challenge<h2>
		<p>My biggest challege in this lab was figuring out whether or not I was doing the Lab correctly. I don't know if I did the pseudocoding part right and it was aparently too late for me to find a partner to help.<p>
	<h2>Problems<h2>
		<p>A big problem I had while doing this lab was trying to figure out if the tasks I wrote out for my pseudocode was sufficient. I also didn't know if what I typed out in the JavaScript file was actually doing anything.<p>
	<h2>Results<h2>
		<p>The result of this lab was I was able to make a list of tasks. I then turned those tasks into JavaScript comments and pasted them into my js folder. I pseudocoded the steps of washing a pot for task 1. Then I created pseudocode for a game of rock paper scissors.<p>
		<pre><code>
		//Display the Rock Paper Scissor options
		//Accept user input
		//Choose random move
		//Test of win, draw, or lose condition
