      <h1>Lab 12: <span id="title">Conditionals</span></h1>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>One of the challenges I had working on this lab was trying to troubleshoot different issues, I had a couple spelling errors.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>The biggest problem I had troubleshooting in the javascript. I wasn't able to get the submit button fuctioning properly.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>I was able to insert the button but for whatever reason I wasn't able to actually get it to function the way I wanted it to.</p>
      <div class="input-output">
