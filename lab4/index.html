	<h2>Challenge<h2>
		<p>My biggest challege in this lab was figuring out whether or not I was doing the Lab correctly. I don't know if I did the pseudocoding part right and it was aparently too late for me to find a partner to help.<p>
	<h2>Problems<h2>
		<p>A big problem I had while doing this lab was trying to figure out if the tasks I wrote out for my pseudocode was sufficient. I also didn't know if what I typed out in the JavaScript file was actually doing anything.<p>
	<h2>Results<h2>
		<p>The result of this lab was I was able to make a list of tasks. I then turned those tasks into JavaScript comments and pasted them into my js folder. Hopefully I did what I was supposed to.<p>
